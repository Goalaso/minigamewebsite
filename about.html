            <h2>Welcome to Pixel Playground!</h2>
            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>Pixel Playground is a minigames website that is a platform designed to offer a collection of engaging and
                fun minigames to users.
                Developed as part of the CS 410 Software Engineering course, this project aims to provide a seamless and
                enjoyable gaming experience through a well-integrated frontend, backend, and game engine.</p>

            <h3>Features</h3>
            <p>Variety of Games: Enjoy multiple minigames including puzzles, action, and strategy games.</p>
            <p>User-Friendly Interface: Easy navigation and intuitive design.</p>
            <p>Scoring System: Track your scores and compete with others.</p>
            <p>User Accounts: Create an account, login, and manage your profile.</p>
            <p>Leaderboards: See how you stack up against other players.</p>

            <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
            <p>Frontend: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
            <p>Backend: Powered by PHP with SQLite3 for database management.</p>

            <!-- edit -->
            <h3>Architecture</h3>
                <p>Frontend-Backend Interaction: The frontend communicates with the backend using RESTful APIs.</p>
                <p>Data Flow: User actions and game data are sent to the backend, processed, and stored in the SQLite3 database. The backend serves game state data to the frontend and Godot.</p>
                <p>Hosting: The application is hosted on Heroku with a CI/CD pipeline for continuous deployment.</p>

                management and GitHub for version control were crucial in our development process.</p>
